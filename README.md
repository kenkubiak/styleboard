# StyleBoard

**StyleBoard** is a single-page web application which analyzes the CSS
of your site and generates an interactive styleguide which documents
and tests your CSS.

Using modular CSS conventions (such as [SMACSS](smacss.com)), **StyleBoard**
will find patterns in the CSS and build a styleguide for those patterns,
including example uses of the patterns.
Additional documentation and examples can be explicitly declared in the
CSS comments using "`@`" tags.
